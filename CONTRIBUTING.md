### üé® Coding Standards

#### TypeScript & React

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries

#### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow existing code patterns and structure

#### Component Structure

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { Icon } from 'lucide-react'

interface ComponentProps {
  title: string
  isActive?: boolean
}

export function ComponentName({ title, isActive = false }: ComponentProps) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false)

  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      className="glass-dark rounded-lg p-4"
    >
      {/* Component content */}
    </motion.div>
  )
}
```

#### Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the dark theme color scheme
- Use existing CSS classes when possible:
  - `glass-dark` for glassmorphism effects
